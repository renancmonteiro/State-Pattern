State Pattern

Implemented in Netbeans 8.0.2 using JDK 1.8

The state pattern, which closely resembles Strategy Pattern, is a behavioral software design pattern,
also known as the objects for states pattern. This pattern is used in computer programming to encapsulate 
varying behavior for the same routine based on an object's state object. This can be a cleaner way for an 
object to change its behavior at runtime without resorting to large monolithic conditional statements.
